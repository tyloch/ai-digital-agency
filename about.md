Here’s the framework I used—Agency-Swarm:

🌀 5 AI Agents Working in a Swarm Model
💡 Project Director: Evaluates feasibility and strategy
🔧 Technical Architect: Designs the system architecture
📋 Product Manager: Outlines scope and timelines
👩‍💻 Lead Developer: Tackles implementation details
🎯 Client Manager: Ensures delivery and feedback

What makes this unique?
These agents work asynchronously and collaboratively:
➡️ Operate in parallel, just like a real team
➡️ Share insights in real-time
➡️ Make decisions collectively

I initially explored Shubham’s implementation of this framework and then refactored it for better understanding and scalability. The results blew me away:

✅ The agents don’t just follow instructions—they challenge them
✅ They identify risks early
✅ They suggest innovative solutions
